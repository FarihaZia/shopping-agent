* Works with natural language (case-insensitive)
* Falls back to keyword search if category not found

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The agent loads a list of all products using an API.
2. When a user types a query like "Show me women's shoes", it looks for a matching category in the product list.
3. If no exact category is matched, it tries to find products with relevant keywords.
4. The agent returns a list of products matching the user's intent.
5. It's designed to keep logic readable and beginner-friendly.
